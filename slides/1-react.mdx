# React

<br />

A JavaScript library for building user interfaces

<br />
<br />

React helps you to write declarative, component based UIs by using the (optional) JSX syntax.

<br />

```jsx
function MyComponent() {
  return <button onClick={() => alert("Hello World!")}>Click Me!</button>;
}
```

<br />

If you render this component, it will look like this:

<button onClick={() => alert("Hello World!")}>Click me!</button>
